# Hello Joshua Lagrimas
This is my first repository and how to actually create my own personal project repo.

I am focused, and reserved and I finish task based on the data and context of my clients and consumers needs 
and improve on that. My goal is to really contribute one day in the entertainment industry and create games, write stories,
and satisfy my consumers needs in correlation to the deadline. 

I want to be the best.
